		Navigation related stuff
		Something to consider is that you want to link to all of your webpages from the webpage you're currently on...
		This may entail using a navbar. Overkill would be to use Bootstrap. Alternatively you could use stuff on W3
			https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp

		First, if you want to link to something, it needs to exist. Further, you need to confirm where you're linking to.
		Currently you're using relative links, which means Norway.html needs to be in the same directory as index.html
		If it were in a directory called countries, you have to say <a href="countries/Norway.html">Norway</a>
		An example of a complete directory path is <a href="file:///Users/serenityrose/Documents/GitHub/project-one-template/Norway.html">Norway</a>
